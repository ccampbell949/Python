#Note that this is not a script, just notes


#if spam = 'Hello World!'

#spam[0] would return 'H'. This is an 'index'

#spam[1:5] is a slice, and would return 'ello' i.e. starts at index 1, and goes
#to index 4, as it stops one short of the end index given

#spam[-1] would return '!' as the negative number goes from right to left

#'Hello' in spam would evaluate to True
