# Python-Practice-Portfolio
# Hello
# This is a series of practice Python codes and personal projects to help me improve my skills as a coder.
# My background is in Aerospace engineering, in which I had exposure to Python in my final year dissertation. 
# Now, I am interested in a career change into programming and software development and so I am trying to both brush up on my past skill alongside expanding my knowledge of Python and it's many different applications.
